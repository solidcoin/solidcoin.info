History
-------
SolidCoin officially launched on August 20th, 2011. After numerous attacks and threats, we realized there were too many flaws in the Bitcoin code SolidCoin was at that stage mostly based on, so the network was shutdown as of September 21st, 2011.

On October 11th, 2011, the network restarted, this time running a protocol which fixed all major flaws in other P2P cryptocurrencies, along with many other improvements designed for mass appeal. SolidCoin now stands head and shoulders above the competition in ease of use, security and network speed.

Improvements from Bitcoin
-------------------------

You might say, what is different about SolidCoin than Bitcoin? Here is a list of some of the features that have been vastly improved:

### Protocol changes
* Significantly faster transaction processing
* [51% attack protection](http://solidcoin.info/solidcoin-most-secure-currency.php)
* Network Mining Power (NMP) variance handling
* 4 decimal points instead of 8, making it easier to view amounts
* 6 hourly difficulty retargets
* 2 minute blocks
* A base value of 32 SolidCoins per ODD block.
* Even blocks can only be generated by "trusted nodes" and contain 5% of an odd block and are given to the CPF
* Anyone can become a decentralized trusted node once they have enough investment in the SolidCoin economy (currently 1 million SC)
* No maximum coin generation, a small inflation amount at the end which will increase value of each coin over time whilst providing economic liquidity
* CPU hashing algorithm which GPUs are currently inefficient at, increasing the userbase of miners tremendously

### Offical client improvements

* Supports multiple wallets
* Interface improvements
* Developer improvements, making it easier and more secure for businesses
* More efficient and stable client for users and businesses

### 51% attack protection

The 51% attack is a major flaw in most cryptocurrencies that allows an attacker with more than 50% of the network's computing power to:

* Reverse transactions
* Halt the network to a stop
